						<li>Archived Products: 
							<p>An archived product is a downloadable unit of Earth Observation data acquired during a given period, 
							having a given footprint (except in the case of global products) and processed to a certain level (i.e. Level 0, 1, 2, 3 or n).
							An archived product has always a product URI.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Acquired Products: 
							<p>Acquired products are similar, in ngEO, to archived products except that product URL is not provided.
							Thus acquired products cannot be downloaded. Acquired products are only expected to be used in CDS datasets.
							</p> 
						</li>
						<li>Planned Products: 
						<p>Planned products are products that are not already acquired (i.e. their acquisition time is normally in the future) 
						but whose acquisition that can be nonetheless predicted.
						</p> 
						</li>
						<li>Cancelled  Products: 
							<p>They are former planned products that were removed from the planning. They are handled exactly as planned products and are only expected to be used in CDS datasets.</p>
