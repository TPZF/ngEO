<h2>Data Access Services</h2>

<p>The data access services are the main functionalities of ngeo.
	They consist in :
<ul>
	<li>catalogue searching using dataset geo-temporal criteria
		and/or dataset inhert criteria</li>
	<li>retrieving products metadata and data</li>
	<li>submitting data access requests</li>
	<li>Visualizing and manipulating data on the map.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol>
	<li><h3 id="catalogSearch">Catalog Search</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><h4 id="datasetSelection">Datasets Selection</h4>
				<p>
					The first and necessary step to make a catalogue search is to
					choose a dataset. The dataset selection widget is accessible via
					the <img src="screenshots/toolBarIcons/datasetsIcon.png" />.
					When the button is clicked, the widget is opened and it displays
					the list of available datasets. Each dataset is represented by
					its name and the number of items it contains. <img
						class="center-img" src="screenshots/datasetSelectionWidget.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="screenshots/warning.png" /> If there where a
					connection problem with the server an error message is spawned
					and the user is notified. The datasets button is then disabled.
					If the server sends no datsets, a notification message is
					displayed inside the dataset selection widget.
				</p>
				<p>
					To select a dataset, the user has to scroll out the list and
					choose the dataset by clicking on the list entry. It is also
					possible to filter the available list of datasets by the means
					of the filter comboBoxes. The filtering criteria are received
					from the server, but they should mainly contain : mission,
					sensor and keywords. <img class="center-img"
						src="screenshots/datasetFilters.png" /> By defaults all the
					criteria are set to "None". As soon as a criteria is choosen in
					one of the combo boxes, the datsets are filtred and the list is
					updated, taken into account the other combo boxes selected
					criteria. <img class="center-img"
						src="screenshots/datasetFiltering1.png" /> <img
						class="center-img" src="screenshots/datasetFiltering2.png" />
					In order to disable the filtering for a criterion, set back the
					selected option to "None".
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h4 id="searchCriteria">Search Criteria</h4>
				<p>
					Once a dataset has been selected, to set the search criteria,
					the user has to click on the <img
						src="screenshots/toolBarIcons/searchIcon.png" /> on the
					toolbar. The search criteria widget is then displayed. <img
						class="center-img" src="screenshots/dateCriteria.png" /> It is
					composed of several tabs, each tab displays one search criteria
					type. Each button on the footer has his own role.
				<p>
					The Search URL button <img src="screenshots/searchURLButton.png" />,
					when clicked, displays the openSearch Url wich will be
					submitted.<img class="center-img"
						src="screenshots/openSearchUrlPopup.png" />. The Standing
					Order button <img src="screenshots/STOButton.png" />, when
					clicked, displays the Standing Order Widget. See <a
						href="#STODar">Standing Order Data Access Request</a>. The
					Submit Search button submits the search request to the server to
					retrive the results. See <a href="#resultsTable">Search
						Results</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="screenshots/tip.png" /> <b>The openSearch url to
						submit is created according to all the criteria selected inside
						the search criteria widget.</b>
				</p> There search criteria types are :
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h5 id="dateCriteria">Date Criteria</h5>
