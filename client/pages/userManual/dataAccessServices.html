<h2>Data Access Services</h2>

<p>The data access services are the main functionalities of ngeo.
	They consist in :
<ul>
	<li>catalogue searching using dataset geo-temporal criteria
		and/or dataset inherent criteria</li>
	<li>retrieving products metadata and data</li>
	<li>submitting data access requests</li>
	<li>visualizing and manipulating data on the map.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol>
	<li><h3 id="catalogSearch">Catalog Search</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><h4 id="datasetSelection">Datasets Selection</h4>
				<p>
					The first and necessary step to make a catalogue search is to
					choose a dataset. The dataset selection widget is accessible by clicking on
					the <img src="screenshots/toolBarIcons/datasetsIcon.png" /> button.
					When the button is clicked, the widget is opened and it displays
					the list of available datasets. Each dataset is represented by
					its name and the number of items it contains. <img
						class="center-img" src="screenshots/datasetSelectionWidget.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="screenshots/warning.png" /> If there where a
					connection problem with the server an error message is spawned
					and the user is notified. The datasets button is then disabled.
					If the server sends no datasets, a notification message is
					displayed inside the dataset selection widget.
				</p>
				<p>
					To select a dataset, the user has to scroll out the list and
					choose the dataset by clicking on the list entry. It is also
					possible to filter the available list of datasets by the means
					of the filter combo boxes. The filtering criteria are received
					from the server, but they should mainly contain : mission,
					sensor and keywords. <img class="center-img"
						src="screenshots/datasetFilters.png" /> 
					<p>By default, all the
					criteria are set to "None". As soon as a criteria is chosen in
					one of the combo boxes, the datasets are filtered and the list is
					updated, taken into account the other combo boxes selected
					criteria.</p>
					<img class="center-img"
						src="screenshots/datasetFiltering1.png" /> 
						
					<p>Here is an examaple of the mission and sensor criteria set to S2 and OPT.</p>	
						<img class="center-img" src="screenshots/datasetFiltering2.png" />
					
					<p>
					In order to disable the filtering for a criterion, set back the
					selected option to "None".</p>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><h4 id="searchCriteria">Search Criteria</h4>
				<p>
					Once a dataset has been selected, to set the search criteria,
					the user has to click on the button <img
						src="screenshots/toolBarIcons/searchIcon.png" /> on the
					toolbar. The search criteria widget is then displayed. <img
						class="center-img" src="screenshots/dateCriteria.png" />
					<p>	It is
					composed of several tabs, each tab displays one search criteria
					type. Each button on the footer has his own role.</p>
				<p>
					The Search URL button <img src="screenshots/searchURLButton.png" />,
					when clicked, displays the openSearch url which will be
					submitted.</p>
					<img class="center-img"
						src="screenshots/openSearchUrlPopup.png" />
				<p>The Standing
				Order button <img src="screenshots/STOButton.png" />, when
				clicked, displays the Standing Order Widget. See <a
					href="#STODar">Standing Order Data Access Request</a>. The
				Submit Search button submits the search request to the server to
				retrieve the results. See <a href="#resultsTable">Search
					Results</a>.</p>
				<p>The Share button <img src="screenshots/shareButton.png" />, when
				clicked, displays a popup with the search shared url.</p>
				Copy the url and paste it in a new browser window, the search widget is displayed with all the search parameters set.
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="screenshots/tip.png" /> <b>The openSearch url to
						submit is created according to all the criteria selected inside
						the search criteria widget.</b>
				</p> There search criteria types are :
				<ul>

							coordinates can be entered manually is each text field.</li>
						</p>
					<li><h5 id="advancedCriteria">Advanced Criteria</h5>
						<p>They are criteria relative to the selected dataset, so
							they change depending on the dataset chosen.
