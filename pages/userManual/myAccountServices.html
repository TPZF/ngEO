				monitor the users'download managers. Several download managers can
				be installed by a user on different working machines. The user
				interface allows to install a local download manager through the
				link displayed in the Download managers tab.</p>

				bar.

				Information details are displayed for each of the available
				download managers : status, identifier, name, user ID, IP Address
				and the last access date. <img class="center-img"

				possible statuses:
			<ul>
				<li>ACTIVE: is represented by the <img

					ACTIVE download manager is actually downloading products.
				</li>

				<li>INACTIVE: is represented by the <img

					does not have ongoing downloading tasks.
				</li>

				<li>STOPPED: is represented by the <img
					src="screenshots/cancelledIcon.png" alt='MENUBAR IMAGE' /> icon.

					purge scheduled/paused Product downloads, but continue ongoing downloading activities until these are finished.</p>
				</li>

				<li>Stop Immediately: is represented respectively by the
					button <img src="screenshots/dmStopImmediatelyButton.png"
					alt='STOP DM BUTTON' /> icon.

				</li>
			</ul>

				command buttons are updated according to the download manager
				status. When a command button is clicked, the status change
				request is sent to the server and a notification message is
