 		<h2 id="WhatIsNGEO">What Is ngEO?</h2>
		<p>
			<p> ngEO is the Next Generation Earth Observation system designed to manage end-user Earth Observation services. </p>
			<p> It is deployable in several contexts such as: the Sentinel PDGS, the CDS, the Multi-mission infrastructure and EarthCARE.</p>
 		</p>
 	</li>	
 	<li>
		 <h2 id="Purpose">Document Purpose</h2>
		 <p>This user guide provides a description of ngEO User Client interface and how to use it.</p>

				<li><h3>Dataset</h3>
					<p> A dataset is a group of products. Various criteria are used to define a dataset such as : the use of products in a particular domain, the products meta data attributes, the user community. </p>
					<p> There are four types of datasets: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Native Dataset: products are grouped by the same mission/sensor/sensor mode/product type, it is basically an eoli like collection.</li>
						<li>Logical Dataset: is a dataset handled by the ngeo system for which products are associated . </li>
						<li>Remote Dataset: is a  dataset handled by external catalogues either by another ngeo instances or by HMA catalogues. Like HMA datsets and GCM.</li>
						<li>Virtual Dataset: it is a dataset composed by one of the above three type.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p> From the user interface, the dataset types are not visible but according to its profile, the user can see the list of datasets his is authorized to access. </p>
				</li>	
				
				<li><h3>Product</h3>
					<p> There are four types of products supported by ngEO: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Archived Products: 
							<p>An archived product is a downloadable unit of Earth Observation data acquired during a given period, 
							having a given footprint (except in the case of global products) and processed to a certain level (i.e. Level 0, 1, 2, 3 or n).
							An archived product has always a product URI.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Acquired Products: 
							<p>Acquired products are similar, in ngEO, to archived products except that product URL is not provided.
							Thus acquired products cannot be downloaded. Acquired products are only expected to be used in CDS datasets.
							</p> 
						</li>
						<li>Planned Products: 
						<p>Planned products are products that are not already acquired (i.e. their acquisition time is normally in the future) 
						but whose acquisition that can be nonetheless predicted.
						</p> 
						</li>
						<li>Cancelled  Products: 
							<p>They are former planned products that were removed from the planning. They are handled exactly as planned products and are only expected to be used in CDS datasets.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<!--p>When a user performs a search, he retrievs the products metadata. If the product has a url, it can be downloded<p-->
				</li>
			
				<li><h3>Download Manager</h3>
					<p>It is software which is retrieved and run in standalone. It is used to the download of product data.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Simple Data Access Request</h3>
					<p>It is a request issued from the user client in order to retrive products having a url.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h3>Standing Order Data Access Request</h3>
					<p>It is a request issued from the user client in order to schedule searches either by data or by time.</p>
				</li>
